The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
